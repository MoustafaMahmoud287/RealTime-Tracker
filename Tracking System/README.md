## Description
A real-time object tracking system developed using **C++** and **CUDA** to achieve high-performance tracking of objects in video frames. This system uses the **CIELUV color space** for robust color-based object detection under varying lighting conditions. It leverages **CUDA** to parallelize image processing tasks, ensuring real-time tracking even for high-resolution videos.

## Features
- 🎯 Real-time object tracking on video streams
- 🎨 Uses CIELUV color space for perceptual color accuracy
- 🧠 Custom thresholding and region-based analysis
- 🚀 CUDA acceleration for GPU-parallel image processing
- 🖼️ High performance on high-resolution video frames
