# Real-Time Object Tracking (Graduation Project)

## Description
A real-time object tracking system developed using **C++** and **CUDA** to achieve high-performance tracking of objects in video frames. This system uses the **CIELUV color space** for robust color-based object detection under varying lighting conditions. It leverages **CUDA** for parallelizing image processing tasks, providing real-time tracking even for high-resolution videos.

## Features
- Real-time object tracking on video streams.
- CIELUV color space for accurate and perceptually uniform color analysis.
- Custom thresholding and region-based analysis for high precision in tracking.
- CUDA-accelerated image processing for improved performance.
- Real-time performance on high-resolution video frames.
