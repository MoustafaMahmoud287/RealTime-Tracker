#Real-Time Object Tracking (Graduation Project)#
Description
A real-time object tracking system developed using C++ and CUDA to achieve high-performance tracking of objects in video frames. This system uses the CIELUV color space for robust color-based object detection under varying lighting conditions. It leverages CUDA for parallelizing image processing tasks, providing real-time tracking even for high-resolution videos.

Features
Real-time object tracking on video streams.

CIELUV color space for accurate and perceptually uniform color analysis.

Custom thresholding and region-based analysis for high precision in tracking.

CUDA-accelerated image processing for improved performance.

Real-time performance on high-resolution video frames.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
Set up dependencies:

Ensure that you have CUDA installed on your system. You can follow the installation guide for CUDA from here.

Set up any necessary libraries or dependencies used in the project (e.g., libraries for handling video streams).

Build the project:

Compile the project using your preferred C++ IDE or command line with the appropriate flags to link CUDA libraries.

Usage
To run the object tracking system:

Compile the project.

Provide a video file or connect a webcam to start tracking.

The program will display the video with real-time tracking.

Dependencies
C++

CUDA Toolkit (for GPU acceleration)

Win32 API (for Windows-based GUI)

Future Work
Adding a Machine Learning model for object recognition.

Optimizing performance for additional real-time applications.
